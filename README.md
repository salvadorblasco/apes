# APES: The All-Purpose Equilibrium Solver

**APES** is a software suite for solving equilibrium in solution, refinement
of formation constants and other utilities.


## Install APES

In order to run APES you will need `python3 <http://www.python.org/>`_
installed on your machine. The program also needs the following modules:

* `numpy <http://numpy.org/>`_
* `scipy <http://scipy.org/>`_
* `pyqtgraph <https://www.pyqtgraph.org/>`_ or `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_
* `PyQt5 <https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro>`_

It is pretty straightforward to start working with APES straight away.

## Importing data

APES is able to import data from a variety of formats including Superquad and Hyperquad.
